# Spotify Web Client with React-Redux and Styled-Components
**Demo available on [Netlify](https://spotify-copy.netlify.com/)**
(*Work in progress*)


## This app is a simple copy of Spotify Web Client
It was done to practice and improve with React&Redux & Styled-Components.
App is not perfect and definitely needs some cleaning and improvements.

Things I've learned while building this app:
- token authorization
- basics of Web Audio API
- styled-components in practice
- configuring eslint & prettier
- implementing protected routes

### To-do:
- [x] RWD
- [x] Token Auth
- [x] Audio Track Preview *note that not all tracks possess 30s preview*
- [ ] Single Playlist view
- [ ] Error handling
- [ ] Improve Audio Player
