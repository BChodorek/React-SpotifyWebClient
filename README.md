# Spotify Web Client with React-Redux and Styled-Components
**Demo available on [Netlify](https://spotify-copy.netlify.com/)**
(*Work in progress*)

*note that not all tracks possess 30sec preview so audio won't work for certain songs*

## This app is a simple copy of Spotify Web Client
It was done to practice and improve with React&Redux & Styled-Components.
App is not perfect and definitely needs some cleaning and improvements.

Things I've learned while building this app:
- token authorization
- implementing protected routes
- basics of Web Audio API
- styled-components in practice
- configuring eslint & prettier
-

### To-do:
- [x] RWD
